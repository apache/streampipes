# StreamPipes client for Python

Apache StreamPipes meets Python! We are working highly motivated on a Python-based client to interact with StreamPipes.
In this way, we would like to unite the power of StreamPipes to easily connect to and read different data sources, especially in the IoT domain,
and the amazing universe of data analytics libraries in Python.

**The current version of this Python client is still in alpha phase at best.**
<br>
**This means that it is still heavily under development, which may result in frequent and extensive API changes, unstable behavior, etc.**
<br>
**Please consider it only as a sneak preview.**
