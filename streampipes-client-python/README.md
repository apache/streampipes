<h3 align="center">Apache StreamPipes client for Python</h3>

<p align="center"> Apache StreamPipes meets Python! We are working highly motivated on a Python-based client to interact with StreamPipes.
In this way, we would like to unite the power of StreamPipes to easily connect to and read different data sources, especially in the IoT domain,
and the amazing universe of data analytics libraries in Python. </p>
