    "### Why there is an extra Python client for StreamPipes\n",
    "[Apache StreamPipes](https://streampipes.apache.org/) aims to enable non-technical users to connect and analyze IoT data streams.\n",
    "To this end, it provides an easy-to-use and convenient user interface that allows one to connect to an IoT data source and create some visual\n",
    "graphs within a few minutes. <br>\n",
    "Although this is the main use case of Apache StreamPipes, it can also provide great value for people who are eager to work on data analysis or data science with IoT data, but don't we do get in touch with all the hassle associated with extracting data from devices in a suitable format.\n",
    "In this scenario, StreamPipes helps you connect to your data source and extract the data for you.\n",
    "You then can make the data available outside StreamPipes by writing it into an external source, such as a database, Kafka, etc.\n",
    "While this requires another component, you can also extract your data directly from StreamPipes programmatically using the StreamPipes API.\n",
    "For convenience, we also provide you with a StreamPipes client both available for Java and Python.\n",
    "Specifically with the Python client, we want to address the amazing data analytics and data science community in Python and benefit from the great universe of Python libraries out there.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to install the Python client\n",
    "Up to this point, we do not provide a release of the Python client in any of the package indexes known for Python.\n",
    "This will probably start with StreamPipes `1.0.0` when we officially launch the Python client.\n",
    "Until then, you can just install the currently available development version of the client directly from GitHub.\n",
    "Simply use the following `pip` command:"

    "### How to configure the Python client\n",
    "In order to access the resources available in StreamPipes, one must be able to authenticate against the backend.\n",
    "For this purpose, the client sofar only supports the authentication via an API token that can be generated via the StreamPipes UI, as you see below.\n",
