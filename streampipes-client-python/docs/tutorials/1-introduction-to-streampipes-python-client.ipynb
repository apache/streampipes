    "### Why there is an extra Python library for StreamPipes?\n",
    "[Apache StreamPipes](https://streampipes.apache.org/) aims to enable non-technical users to connect and analyze IoT data streams.\n",
    "To this end, it provides an easy-to-use and convenient user interface that allows one to connect to an IoT data source and create some visual\n",
    "graphs within a few minutes. <br>\n",
    "Although this is the main use case of Apache StreamPipes, it can also provide great value for people who are eager to work on data analysis or data science with IoT data, but don't we do get in touch with all the hassle associated with extracting data from devices in a suitable format.\n",
    "In this scenario, StreamPipes helps you connect to your data source and extract the data for you.\n",
    "You then can make the data available outside StreamPipes by writing it into an external source, such as a database, Kafka, etc.\n",
    "While this requires another component, you can also extract your data directly from StreamPipes programmatically using the StreamPipes API.\n",
    "For convenience, we also provide you with a StreamPipes client both available for Java and Python.\n",
    "Specifically with StreamPipes Python, we want to address the amazing data analytics and data science community in Python and benefit from the great universe of Python libraries out there.\n",
