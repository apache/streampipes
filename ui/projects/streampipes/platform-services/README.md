# PlatformServices

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.0.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project platform-services` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project platform-services`.

> Note: Don't forget to add `--project platform-services` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file.

## Build

Run `ng build platform-services` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

After building your library with `ng build platform-services`, go to the dist folder `cd dist/platform-services` and run `npm publish`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test platform-services` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
