## Apache StreamPipes Wrapper for Python - DEPRECATED

StreamPipes effort to support Python is continued in [StreamPipes Python](https://github.com/apache/streampipes/tree/dev/streampipes-client-python):
- [Documentation](https://streampipes.apache.org/docs/docs/python/latest/)
- [Download from PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/streampipes/)

Therefore this module is deprecated from version 0.92.0 on and will probably be remove in 0.93.0.
