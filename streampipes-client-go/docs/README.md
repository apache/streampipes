# Apache StreamPipesocs Go Client Documentation

This directory contains the documentation for the Apache StreamPipes Go Client. The documentation is built and displayed using the [Docsy](https://www.docsy.dev/) theme under the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework.

## Running Locally

To build the documentation site locally, the prerequisites are to have the Go language environment installed, as well as Hugo.

You can then start the server with the following command:

```bash
hugo server
```

This will launch a local server, which is typically accessible at `http://localhost:1313`.
