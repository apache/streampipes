Prerequisites to use StreamPipes Go.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

Before you begin, you will need to have the following prerequisites:

## 1. Go Environment

Ensure that the [Go](https://go.dev/) programming language environment is properly installed on your computer.

You can verify this by running a command line:

```shell
go version
```

If Go is not installed, you can download and install it from the [official Go website](https://go.dev/).

## 2. Apache StreamPipes instance

Access to a running instance of Apache StreamPipes is required.

If you do not have it set up yet, please refer to the [Apache StreamPipes installation guide](https://streampipes.apache.org/docs/try-installation/) for detailed instructions on how to install and configure it on your system.

Once these requirements are met, you are ready to proceed with the next step Quickstart in the setup process!
