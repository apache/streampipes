###  Manage StreamPipes Adapter
---
## Initialize Go-Client
```bash
import (
	"log"
	"github.com/apache/streampipes/streampipes-client-go/streampipes"
	"github.com/apache/streampipes/streampipes-client-go/streampipes/config"
)
func main() {
      clientConfig := config.StreamPipesClientConfig{
            Url: "http://localhost:8030",
            Credential: config.StreamPipesApiKeyCredentials{
                UserName: "<Your-User-Name>",
                ApiKey:   "<Your-API-Key>",
            },
        }
    
      streamPipesClient, err := streampipes.NewStreamPipesClient(clientConfig)
      if err != nil {
          log.Fatal(err)
      }

}
```

### Create a StreamPipes Adapter

```bash
      // Populating go-model as a data source is not supported at this time,This is because the inheritance of the model has not been resolved for the time being.
      adapterData = `json`
      adapter = []byte(adapterData) 
	  err := streamPipesClient.Adapter().CreateAdapter(adapterData) 
```

### Get a StreamPipes Adapter

```bash
	streampipesAdapter, err := streamPipesClient.Adapter().GetSingleAdapter("adapterId")
```

### Start a StreamPipes Adapter

```bash
	err := streamPipesClient.Adapter().StartSingleAdapter("adapterId")
```

### Stop a StreamPipes Adapter

```bash
	err := streamPipesClient.Adapter().StopSingleAdapter("adapterId")
```
