## Description

This processor creates a JTS LineString geometry from  JTS Points events, represent a trajectory. A trajectory is defined  as the path that a moving object follows through space as a function of time. Each sub-point of this LineString represents a single event. The latest sub-point represents the latest geo-event. For each Point event it is also possible to store an additional m-value representing for example actually speed, distance, duration or direction of this event. A trajectory consists of at least two sub-point and can't be infinitive, so a threshold of maximum allowed sub-points is required. When the sub-point threshold is exceeded, the oldest point is removed from the LineString.
***

## Required inputs

*  WKT String of a JTS Point Geometry
*  Integer value representing EPSG code
*  Number value for M-value


***

## Configuration

Creates a JTS Geometry LineString from a JTS Point Geometries events representing a trajectory.


### 1st parameter
Point WKT String

### 2nd parameter
EPSG code value

### 3rd parameter
M-value for each sub-point of the trajectory

### 4rd parameter
String for a description text for the trajectory

### 5rd parameter
Number of allowed sub-points

***

## Output

Adds a LineString geometry in the Well Known Text to the event, representing a trajectory. Also the description text is added to the event stream. The first existing event creates an empty LineString.

### Example
Creating a LineString with a threshold of 2 allowed sub-points:

* First Event:
  * Point(8.12 41.23) --> LineString <empty>
* Second Event:
  * Point(8.56 41.25) --> LineString(8.12 41.23, 8.56 41.25)
* Second Event:
  * Point(8.84 40.98) --> LineString(8.56 41.25, 8.84 40.98)

M-value is not represented in the LineString but will be stored for internal use!
